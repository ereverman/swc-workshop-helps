To review the steps of the collaboration exercise:
    Fork  (cloud)
    clone (cloud to local your copy)
    edits/changes (local)
    git add and commit to version (local)
    git push (local to cloud your copy)
    pull request (cloud) (notify upstream (owner) available changes)
    owner/upstream can accept, ask for more detail, decline
After upstream repository has accepted pull requests, we want to capture all those changes to our local
    add remote upstream (local)
    fetch from upstream to forked(own) (local)
    merge upstream/master to local master (local)
    push to origin  (local to cloud) own
